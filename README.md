Work still in progress.

Building
===

The build requires that you have [CMake](http://cmake.org/) installed. Although
you can build within the source directory, your life will probably be easier if
you build in a separate directory to avoid polluting the source directory.

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake /path/to/bfarchive
    $ make
    $ make test

Support

Any issues or questions regarding this software should be filed via
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/bigfix/bfarchive/issues).
